# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction-Analysis
After the pandemic, the airline industry faced huge losses. According to ICAO, airlines lost around 371 billion dollars in 2020, and 329 billion dollars due to fewer available seats. Because of the current economic slowdown, it's very important to understand what problems customers are facing and find ways to make them happier with the services

This is a binary classification problem, where we need to predict which category a passenger falls into based on their satisfaction with the airline: Satisfied or Neutral/
Dissatisfied. Before looking at the data, and speaking from personal experience as a frequent traveller, the key factors that likely affect a passenger’s satisfaction are:

• Flight delays – Long or frequent delays often lead to frustration.
• Staff efficiency – How quickly and politely the staff respond to passenger needs plays a big role.
• In-flight services – Things like food, entertainment, and cleanliness can strongly influence overall satisfaction

We'll follow these steps systematically to ensure a clear, data-driven approach that leads to meaningful insights and accurate prediction results:

1. Problem Understanding
◦ Goal: Predict if a passenger is Satisfied or Neutral/Dissatisfied.
2. Data Exploration
◦ Load data, check structure, handle missing values, visualize key trends.
3. Data Preprocessing
◦ Encode categorical data, scale features, and combine labels if needed.
4. Model Building
◦ Split data, train models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and test
performance.
5. Model Evaluation
◦ Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
6. Insights & Recommendations
◦ Analyse important features and suggest service improvements.
7. (Optional) Deployment
◦ Build a basic app or dashboard for real-time prediction.

# Power Bi Dashboard & Its Uses
The Power BI dashboard created for customer satisfaction analysis serves as a visual storyteller for airline performance. It transforms raw passenger feedback and operational data into clear, digestible visuals that help stakeholders make quick, informed decisions.


# Key Uses of the Dashboard:
1. Performance Tracking: Visualises real-time performance metrics like satisfaction scores and service quality.
2. Pattern Detection: Highlights trends in delays, service gaps, and demographic behaviours.
3. Decision Support: Helps management pinpoint exact areas needing improvement (e.g., check-in, cleanliness).
4. Business Strategy: Drives targeted actions to boost customer experience and retention.

 # Short Story Behind the Dashboard
This dashboard was made to understand how more than one lakh passengers feel about their flying experience. Instead of just guessing, the aim was to use data to get a clear picture of what passengers like, what they don’t, and what needs to be improved.
As we explored the data, some interesting things stood out. Most passengers are loyal and travel for business. This shows that they fly often and have high expectations from the airline. But despite being regular customers, only about 43% of them are satisfied. That’s lower than expected.
We looked deeper and found that service ratings—like check-in, food, cleanliness, and inflight entertainment—were mostly average. Not too bad, but not great either. These average experiences can easily turn into disappointments, especially for frequent flyers.
Delays also seem to play a role. On average, both departure and arrival delays were around 15 minutes. While that may not seem like a lot, it can become frustrating when combined with other small issues.
So, what started as a simple data analysis turned into a clear story. The dashboard shows exactly who the passengers are, what they go through, and where the airline can do better. It highlights the areas that need attention and gives a solid direction for improvement.


# Conclusive Insights & Results Gained:

1. Passenger loyalty is high, with a significant number of frequent and business-class travellers.
2. Despite loyalty, overall satisfaction levels are lower than expected, indicating a service gap.
3. Key weak areas identified: check-in process, food quality, in-flight entertainment, and cleanliness.
4. Flight delays in both departure and arrival are major operational inefficiencies affecting customer experience.
5. The demographic analysis shows that passengers are experienced and expect high standards.
6. Power BI dashboards helped simplify complex data, making it easier to detect underperforming areas.
7. Clear scope for improvement in service delivery and punctuality to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
