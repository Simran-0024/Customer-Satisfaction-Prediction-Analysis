# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction-Analysis
After the pandemic, the airline industry faced huge losses. According to ICAO, airlines lost around 371 billion dollars in 2020, and 329 billion dollars due to fewer available seats. Because of the current economic slowdown, it's very important to understand what problems customers are facing and find ways to make them happier with the services

This is a binary classification problem, where we need to predict which category a passenger falls into based on their satisfaction with the airline: Satisfied or Neutral/
Dissatisfied. Before looking at the data, and speaking from personal experience as a frequent traveller, the key factors that likely affect a passenger’s satisfaction are:

• Flight delays – Long or frequent delays often lead to frustration.
• Staff efficiency – How quickly and politely the staff respond to passenger needs plays a big role.
• In-flight services – Things like food, entertainment, and cleanliness can strongly influence overall satisfaction

We'll follow these steps systematically to ensure a clear, data-driven approach that leads to meaningful insights and accurate prediction results:

1. Problem Understanding
◦ Goal: Predict if a passenger is Satisfied or Neutral/Dissatisfied.
2. Data Exploration
◦ Load data, check structure, handle missing values, visualize key trends.
3. Data Preprocessing
◦ Encode categorical data, scale features, and combine labels if needed.
4. Model Building
◦ Split data, train models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and test
performance.
5. Model Evaluation
◦ Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
6. Insights & Recommendations
◦ Analyze important features and suggest service improvements.
7. (Optional) Deployment
◦ Build a basic app or dashboard for real-time prediction.
